## Howto
1. Make a backup of current rules using 'iptables-save > rules.v4.orig'
2. Change following files: grep -R _host_ . 
3. run bin/make
4. 'iptables-restore < rules.v4'

## TODO
1. We currently have no respect for fail2ban. Is there anyway that we can just change our own part?
   Not fail2ban and fwsnort?
2. Someday there may be a script to do above works.
